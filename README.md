# SuccessiveConvexification
Implementation of [Successive Convexification for Fuel-Optimal Powered Landing with Aerodynamic Drag and Non-Convex Constraints](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adhithya-Babu/post/Lossless_convexification_vs_Successive_convexification/attachment/5f02dbe43909f70001da764f/AS%3A910206900903936%401594021644514/download/_SCvx+for+Fuel-Optimal+Powered+Landing.pdf) by Michael Szmuk and Behcet Acikmese.

Reqires `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy` and `cvxpy`.

Modification of [Sven Niederberger's implementation](https://github.com/EmbersArc/SCvx) of the SCvx algorithm. Modifications include implementation of lossless convexification, aerodynamic effects, and some additional plotting functions.
